Joomla Extensions from Tamlyn Software

18/01/2022

As most people do, in the new year I've taken some time to reflect on my priorities for the year, and have made the decision to not be actively involved in the Joomla community this year.

Unlike many in the Joomla community, my day job does not involve any Joomla, I spend most of my time in the Microsoft ecosystem playing with SharePoint, and Joomla was only ever a hobby. While I did receive some money from my extension business, I've seen that gradually decline over the years, to the point it's now insignificant. In the spirit of Joomla I am open sourcing all my extensions under GNU GPL 3 license and completely shutting down Tamlyn Software. You can now download all these Joomla extensions for free and do with them as you like. 

As per the GNU GPL if you do use any of this code in your own extensions, then you should include attribution to Tamlyn Software and/or Tim Plummer, and any derivative work should also be licensed under GNU GPL.

Do not expect any support or questions answered, use at your own risk.

Through my involvement in the Joomla community, I've made some amazing friendships, learnt so much, and have seen a lot of personal growth.

So long, and thanks for all the fish!
